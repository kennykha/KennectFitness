<b>KennectFitness</b>
<br/>
<i>KennectFitness is a fitness tracking application made with Javascript, React, Node, Express and MySQL.</i>

This application was created with data persistence in mind in order for users to keep track of their workouts. Users are able to add themselves to the platform and select their name in order to start adding workouts to their profile. When a user clicks add workout, they are able to specify the name of the workout, the date, and the number of reps for each set. Additionally, as they are adding their workout within the modal, they can add additional dates which will populate additional fields for them to add date and reps, or they can add additional sets to the current date they're filling out. 

All of the data is persisted using a REST API interfaced with an express server which communicates with the MySQL database in order to keep all of the information a user inputs up to date in real time.
